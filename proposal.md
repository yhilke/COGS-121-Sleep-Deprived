## Project Description:
<p>Our group would like to create a web app that can utilize personal information or data from the world for self improvement. For example, by gathering the data of how long people spend their time on their favorite websites, we can help provide a visual representation for them to understand how much time they have actually spent on each website when they are on the Internet.</p>

## Possible Ideas:
1. Tracking how much time you spent on your phone when you are about to sleep</p>
2. A reminder to tell you when to leave your house when you are about to catch the bus</p>
3. Track how much time you spend on other apps vs your homework
4. A count down timer that restricts the use of Netflix to increase productivity.
5. Weather related advisory
6. Overwatch competitive monitor. If someone was super interested in climbing the ranks they could get a notification when they reach a certain rank in their role/ character.
