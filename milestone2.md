## Storyboard 2: Netflix Prototype
This prototype is related to tracking productivity and distractions and utilizing that data to create a real-time, visual representation of time usage. The storyboard depicts a young student who starts to work on his assignment; he takes a short Netflix break and realizes that he spent more time watching than working. Using the prototype app, he is able to see (via a bar) how much time he has actually spent working vs. playing. In the end, he uses this information to decide how much to "play" when he is done with his work.

3. Once the user has logged in, the site will display a progress bar. The unit for the progress bar is the amount of time user has been active on a particular webpage for the past hour. If the progress bar is over 50%, user will receive the display or notification that they should be watching Netflix. In the example, the user has spent less than 50% of their time on being productive in the past hour and therefore the site is discouraging the user from watching Netflix.
